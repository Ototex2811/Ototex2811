Welcome to my project and research portfolio! I am a Registered Land Surveyor and Geomatics Engineer currently pursuing my MSc in Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation at ITC, University of Twente. My work combines surveying, hydrography, remote sensing, environmental modeling, and geospatial analytics.

## üî¨ Current Research
- **Phenological Modeling Using Hybrid Machine Learning and Process-Based Methods**
  - Predicting onset of leaf-out in temperate ecosystems using historical climate and phenological records.
  - Integrated XGBoost, Random Forest, and a calibrated Process-Based Model (PBM).
  - Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Geopandas

## üìê Surveying & Hydrography Projects
- Topographic survey planning and execution (Total Station, GNSS, RTK, UAS (LiDAR))
- Bathymetric mapping and processing with Echo Sounders
- Geospatial data integration with GIS software

## üìä Geospatial & Environmental Analytics
- Land use and change detection using satellite imagery
- Climate time-series analysis and trend extraction (e.g., GDD, chilling hours)
- Automated workflows for processing field and EO data

## üõ† Tools & Skills
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Geopandas, Rasterio)
- QGIS, ArcGIS, AutoCAD Civil 3D
- Remote Sensing (Sentinel, MODIS, Landsat)
- Machine Learning (Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost)
